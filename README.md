# NoAccidents
I've myself tried to find scripts to simply make it so that I don't accidently pistol whip people close to me while shooting others. After struggling for a while to find one that would do exactly what I wanted, I just made my own. 

This is a simple FiveM script that removes the ability to melee with your weapon while scoped in.

All you have to do is download the zip, and extract it into your server files. After that as long as you start the resource, no more accidents!
