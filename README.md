# NoAccidents
This is a simple FiveM script that removes the ability to melee with your weapon while scoped in. I've myself tried to find scripts to simply make it so that I don't accidently pistol whip people close to me while shooting others. After struggling for a while to find one that would do exactly what I wanted, I just made my own.
